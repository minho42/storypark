}, 
```

## Save images

python 2.downloader.py
```

## Limitations
- Videos are not saved
  - Video only pages were ignored, but there could be some videos that were missed among other images
- Multiple steps to get the job done
- Super slow, takes really long time
  - `python 1.collector.py` only took more than 3 hours to run ðŸ˜³
  - `time.sleep(n)` were used generously to prevent exceptions
  - `python 2.downloader.py` only took more than 1 hour to run ðŸ˜³
